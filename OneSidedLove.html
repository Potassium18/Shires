							<h2>"One-Sided Love <br> A Tribute to L"</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Love, sky, L and I, <br>
							Inseparable once, now only a sigh. <br>
							For though my heart aches, with love so true, <br>
							Being with L, is something I can't do. <br>
							<br>
							
							For she sees me not, as a lover, but friend, <br>
							And my heart is left broken, love never to extend. <br>
							I gaze up at the sky, and imagine we're there, <br>
							Together, hand in hand, without a single care. <br>
							<br>
							
							But reality hits, and I'm brought back to earth, <br>
							With a love so strong, yet only known to me and its worth. <br>
							I cherish the memories, and the thought of what could be, <br>
							But in this one sided love, Lexy and I cannot be. <br>
							<br>
							
							So I'll love from afar, and keep it all inside, <br>
							And hope one day, she'll see me, and my love will no longer hide. <br>
							For though the sky may stretch, and love may never bloom, <br>
							My love for L, will forever be my heart's room.
							<br>
