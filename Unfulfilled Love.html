							<h2>"Unfulfilled Love: <br> A Tale of Avoidance and Longing"</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I try to turn away, to hide from sight, <br>
							To escape the pain, to win the fight. <br>
							Our love is one-sided, that's evident and true, <br>
							Yet my heart still hurts, with every day anew. <br>
							<br> 

							I thought that distance would ease the pain, <br>
							That time would heal, what love had gained. <br>
							But every time I try to move on, <br>
							I find myself drawn, to you alone. <br>
							
							 <br>
							I thought I'd find peace, when you were gone, <br>
							That I'd forget you, with each new dawn. <br>
							But your smile lingers, in my mind, <br>
							And every thought of you, is just so kind. <br>
							
							<br>
							So I tell myself, to walk away, <br>
							To find someone new, each passing day. <br>
							But every time I try, I find, <br>
							That I keep falling, deeper in your mind. <br>
							
							<br> 
							So I'll keep avoiding, the love I feel, <br>
							And try to hide, what's real. <br>
							But deep inside, I know it's true, <br>
							That I keep falling, more in love with you. <br>
							<br>
